iTunes scripts
===============

These are iTunes scripts that I found essential to have, some of these scripts are from Doug Adams, other were adapted by me, and others (like queue) where created by myself.

## Installation
To install all these scripts into your iTunes library, you can manually copy them from this project to Library/iTunes/Scripts (usually the folder path is protected, so you can open the folder from the terminal):

```
open ~/Library/iTunes/Scripts
```

or copy them all by terminal doing:

```
cp *.scpt* ~/Library/iTunes/Scripts/
```

## Usage
- Delete selected, removes physically the song.
- Move Selected, move the selected files to the desired location.
- Whack Current Track, removes physically the song that is being played. WARNING: doesn't asks for confirmation.
